3.Write a shell script to print the n terms in a Fibonacci Series.

4.Write a shell script to read a file and search for the occurrence of a particular word in it.

5.Write a shell script that accepts two numbers as command line arguments and prints all the 
palindrome numbers between the given two numbers.

Exercise 2
----------
1. Write a program which creates a child process and the parent process
waits for the child process to exit after printing the process id of the child and
parent process. (Use: fork, wait, getpid, getppid, exit System Calls).

2. Write a program where a parent process creates a child process and then
the child process loads another program to add two numbers into its memory
space. The parent process should wait for the child process to exit. (Use:
fork, execlp, wait, exit System calls).

3. Write a program which opens the directory in which it is executed, reads
the file contained in it and displays the status of each file contained in it.
(Use: opendir, readdir, closedir and stat System calls).
